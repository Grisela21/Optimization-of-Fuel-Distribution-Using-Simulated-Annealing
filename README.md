# Fuel Distribution Optimization - Hybrid CVRP-IRP

**Optimizing fuel distribution using Simulated Annealing with a hybrid CVRP-IRP model, integrating intermediate Polmoni stations for efficiency improvements.**

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project addresses **real-world fuel distribution optimization** for energy companies like Eni S.p.A. It combines:  
- **CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem)** – efficient tanker routes.  
- **IRP (Inventory Routing Problem)** – inventory-aware delivery.  
- **Polmoni Stations** – intermediate “breathing space” depots for better route flexibility.  
- **Simulated Annealing** – metaheuristic optimization for minimizing km/kl ratio.

## 💡 Key Results
- **km/kl ratio improvement:** 39–42%  
- **Cost reduction:** 9–17%  
- **Travel time:** +10% (slightly higher, outweighed by efficiency gains)  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Simulated Annealing, Capacitated K-Means Clustering  
- **Mathematical Modeling:** CVRP & IRP hybridization  
- **Tools:** MATLAB, LaTeX (Beamer), Python (optional for plotting)  
- **Skills Highlighted:** Route optimization, logistics modeling, hybrid algorithm design, data visualization
